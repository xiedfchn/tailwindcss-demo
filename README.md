# Tailwindcss Demo
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

## Problems Solved
- Freedom
Frameworks like Bootstrap, Material UI gives you a lot of predefined components. Predefined components are easy-to-use, but customization can be a problem. Tailwind CSS give you a bunch of low level utilities classes. With all its classes, you can create and customize your own components as whatever you want. 

- Making Changes Feels Safer
Because the styling is done in the markup instead of an external stylesheet, when you need to change styles, it’s easy to see exactly what you are updating. There are no unintended side effects elsewhere in the app

## Problem Brought
- Not Compatible With UI component library
Since most UI component libraries, like Material UI, Bootstrap, have their own sass/css files, they use their own way to customize comonents.

- Hard to read markup
Readability definitely suffers when using utility classes. Especially if you need different class names for different breakpoints or hover events, you can very quickly end up with very long class names.
